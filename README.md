# pomodolist
*a simple todo list with pomodoro functionality implemented.*

Pomodolist was created with a rails backend and a react frontend utilizing the flux architecture. I chose to try and keep the entire project as polished as possible which definitely was a little bit of a drain time-wise away from some user error feedback I would have wished to implement.

## Features
- [x] RESTful API for users and todos
- [x] Users can create accounts and login
- [x] Users can create todos with a pomodoro count estimate
- [x] Users can select a todo and start a pomodoro

## Future Features
* [ ] Error feedback, due to time constraints giving users feedback about missing information or bad credentials was put on a back burner.
* [ ] Add breaks after the pomodoro
